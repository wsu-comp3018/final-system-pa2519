GST 

Does the policy holder have an ABN (Australian Business Number)? 
If the answer is “No”, the policy holder cannot claim back any GST they paid as part of the premium for the policy, and no further questions are required. 
If the answer is “Yes”, the next question should be:- 

Are you registered for GST or are you GST registered? 
Again, if the answer is No”, no further questions are required. 
In either event, please record the ABN. 
If the answer is “Yes” you will need to ask: 

Are you entitled to claim any of the GST that formed part of the insurance premium on your Business Activity Statement or BAS? 
If not, record the answer as “No”. 
If the answer is “Yes” there is one final question: 

What percentage of the GST you paid as part of your insurance premium, can you claim back? (This is also known as an ITC percentage). 

If the Insured can provide their ITC% then record the details. If the Insured does not know their ITC%, then advise the insured of the following: 
We are required by the ATO to record your ITC% and you are required under the GST legislation to give the information to us when a claim is made. Advise the insured that they will need to find out what their ITC% is by offering the following information. 

Could we suggest that you get those details within the next 10 days, and advise your claims officer of the ITC%. 
This information can be obtained through either the Australian Tax Office, or the accountant.
